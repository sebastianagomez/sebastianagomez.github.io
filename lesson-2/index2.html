            <p class="intro">Using sound design principles in web design creates a site that is easy to use, appealing to view, and more likely to hold a user’s attention. Here are three strategies that every developer should keep in mind as they create user interfaces.</p>

            <section class="sec1">
                <h2>Hick's Law</h2>

                    Hick’s Law states that the more complex an interface, the longer it will take a user to make a choice (and the more likely they are to leave your site). Good design gives a better experience when they are presented with fewer options. 
                    This lets the natural hierarchy of the page guide the user through the layout.

            <section class="sec2">
                <h2>Repetition</h2>

                    Repetition is exactly how it sounds, repeating elements over and over throughout your composition to create a feeling of cohesiveness. 
                    This feels “right” to the mind and helps a viewer mentally organize the information and see the whole page as a single concept.</br><br>
                    Their use of repetition achieves the following: creates a consistent "feel" creates a visual connection between content
                    makes the website more user-friendly reinforces meaning to users.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="sec3">
                <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
                <img src="img2/Apple.jpg" alt="Apple Web Page screenshot">
                <p>Site: <a href="www.apple.com/">www.apple.com</a><br><br>
                    Essentially, this is a way of page layout that visually conveys the order and importance of content. The visual hierarchy is created by drawing certain cues (such as size, color, contrast, shape, position, and arrangement) to create a sense of depth. We experience visual levels every day.<br><br>
    
                    Although visual hierarchy is a key principle of website and product design, the concept itself is by no means difficult to grasp. However, handling it correctly will most likely require trial and error.
